# metarace-v1

Cyclesport results and timing toolkit for Python2/pygtk.

This is a transitional, and in some cases, incompatible update
of the metarace package toward Python3 and gtk/gi. Before updating
from version 1.11 to 1.12, please read [Changes](#Changes) below
and check the example systems default file
[metarace.json](src/data/metarace.json) for any required updates.

Version 1.12 will be the final release of metarace version 1.
See related package [metarace](https://github.com/ndf-zz/metarace)
(version 2) for on-going python3/gi support.


## Pre-Requisites

Static gtk, cairo, pango and rsvg libraries:

   - python2
   - pygtk
   - gtk
   - glib
   - gobject
   - pycairo
   - pango
   - pangocairo
   - rsvg

Support libraries:

   - paho-mqtt
   - pyserial
   - xlwt
   - libscrc


## Changes

In preparation for version 2, this library makes the following major
departures from older releases:

   - "Meet" is now the toplevel type for both track and road races.
   - Telegraph is a thin wrapper on MQTT, completely replacing
     the IRC-backed library with a simpler publish/subscribe
     approach.
   - Single-event, obscure hardware and special-purpose support scripts
     have been removed from the package. The only remaining console
     scripts are: metarace, trackmeet and roadmeet.
   - Transponder decoder interfaces have been altered to be instances
     of a new decoder library. Currently supported decoders:
     Race Result System, Race Result USB, and Chronelec (Tag Heuer)
     Protime/Elite RC/LS.
   - Several modules have been renamed and adjusted to match common
     use (eg printing/report and mirror/export).
   - Application features have been reduced and standardised to meet
     common use.
   - Configparser style .ini files are removed and replaced
     with JSON-backed jsonconfigs throughout.
   - All configuration and setting files are written to disk via
     metarace.savefile(). Related meets which share resources through
     symbolic links should be aware that savefile disconnects symbolic 
     links and enforces a real file in the meet folder.
   - Meet and event configuration options have been adjusted, and in many
     cases, older configs (v1.11 and earlier) may not be correctly read.
   - Default file handling no longer allows fetching of resource files
     from relative paths. Files are expected to be available in the
     meet folder, or the system defaults folder
     (~/Documents/metarace/default)
